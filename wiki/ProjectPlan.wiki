==Core==

===Refactoring===

|| *State* || *Task* || *Description* ||
|| <font color="green">Done</font> || Platform Refactoring || Preparation of the platform for new feature implementations ||
|| <font color="green">Done</font> || Lock free programming || Locks / synchronized blocks removed and replaced by atomics for more performance and optimized multi-threading support ||
|| <font color="green">Done</font> || More multi-threading support || Some parts are running in threading mode (new "!UserActivityScheduler" to observe client timeouts) ||
|| <font color="green">Done</font> || Configuration logging improved || Logging of the used GWTEventService configuration improved ||
|| <font color="green">Done</font> || Test coverage increased || Test coverage increased (to 100% on the server side) ||
|| Open || Queued server calls || Grouping of server calls and optional synchronized/queued method variants for !RemoteEventService (client-server interface) to prevent server call conflicts, when the callback parameter isn't used ||

===Features===

|| *State* || *Task* || *Description* ||
|| <font color="green">Done</font> || !EventFilter enhancements || Additional interfaces and factories to simplify to building filter sequences ||
|| <font color="orange">Partly Done</font> || Timeout listener || Timeout listener to observe client timeouts (moved from GWTEventService 1.2 to 1.1) ||
|| <font color="orange">Started</font> || Revised configuration loading || Improvements in registration of custom configuration loaders and generic proxy for caching purposes ||
|| <font color="orange">Started</font> || Configration with Web-Descriptor || Additional configuration possibility with Web-Descriptor / Servlet-Parameters ||
|| Open || Support for Annotations || Extended support for Annotations (for e.g. for listener-event mappings) ||
|| Open || Simplified listener-event mapping || Simplified listener-event mapping and an optional solution with Annotations ||
|| Open || Optional client side polling || Polling isn't required by GWTEventService, but it could be configured to reduce cycles of server calls when many "unimportant" events can occure. ||
|| <font color="orange">Started</font> || Documentation || Documentation and release notes ||
